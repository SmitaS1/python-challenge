## Hints
	Write one script for each of the provided datasets. Run each script 	separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.

	Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. 	You don't want to lose hours of your hard work! Also make sure that your 	repo has a detailed README.md file.
