# Python Challenge 

In this first part of the activity, you will create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

## Instructions

	The total number of months included in the dataset

	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the 	average of those changes

	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

	Your analysis should align with the following results:

	Financial Analysis
	----------------------------
	Total Months: 86
	Total: $22564198
	Average Change: $-8311.11
	Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
	Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
------------------------------------------------------


## Hints
	Write one script for each of the provided datasets. Run each script 	separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.

	Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. 	You don't want to lose hours of your hard work! Also make sure that your 	repo has a detailed README.md file.
